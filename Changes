Revision history for Perl extension Encode::JP::Mobile

0.14  Sat Jan  5 10:55:39 PST 2008
        - Added File::ShareDir to prereq
          (Thanks to ICERIDER)

0.13  Sat Jan  5 10:01:09 PST 2008
        - Added Encode::JP::Mobile::Charnames to do things like "\N{DoCoMo Beer}"
          (Tokuhiro Matsuno)

0.12  Mon Nov 19 02:41:36 PST 2007
        - removed PRIVATE AREA characters from all ucm files. This
          might be handy if you want to use fallback for those characters in
          private area but don't have correspondent characters.
        - removed some (actually 131) cp932 characters that are
          duplicate with x-sjis-softbank-auto characters. They're not
          mapped in shift_jis anyway.

0.11  Tue Nov 13 18:41:53 PST 2007
        - Added regression tests for docomo, kddi and softbank
        - Added tools/ directory and various extractor tool to create a map
        - Added dat/ directory to contain YAML tables for Softbank, KDDI and DoCoMo
        - Updated POD in Encode::JP::Mobile
        - Added Encode::JP::KDDIJIS to implement encode/decode x-iso-2022-jp-kddi
          (Tokuhiro Matsuno)
        - Fixed the round-trip flag of DoCoMo characters in kddi.ucm
          and vice verca, so they are used only for Unicode -> encoding
          translation
        - Added x-sjis-kddi-auto Unicode to SJIS encoding map to
          x-sjis-kddi and Vice Verca, so they're round-trip safe between
          UTF-8 and SJIS handsets.
        - Added x-sjis-softbank-auto encoding for Softbank 3GC phones.
          (Thanks to Masahiro Chiba)

0.10  Mon Nov 12 14:35:56 PST 2007
        - x-sjis-softbank is now also based on cp932, not Shift_JIS.

0.09  Mon Nov 12 13:11:51 PST 2007
        - Fixed a major mapping error in x-sjis-airedge.ucm by
          removing it, because x-sjis-airedge (and x-sjis-imode as well) is just
          a subset of cp932 (not shift_jis). x-sjis-airedge is now an alias of cp932.

0.08  Mon Nov 12 11:20:42 PST 2007
        - Fixed a bug where Vodafone (Softbank) high-bit operation was incorrect
          (Thanks to Masahiro Chiba, http://www.geminium.com/chiba_blog/2007/06/10/11/)

0.07  Mon Nov 12 04:42:38 PST 2007
        - Renamed shift_jis-* to x-sjis-*.
          The old shift_jis-* encoding names are still aliased for backward compatiblity.
        - Added x-sjis-kddi-auto.ucm, which is based on KDDI/AU
          handset internal SJIS <=> UTF-8 encoding mapping table.
          See http://subtech.g.hatena.ne.jp/miyagawa/20071112/1194865208 for details
          (Thanks to tomi-ru and tokuhirom for testing)

0.06  Mon Nov 12 01:45:42 PST 2007
        - Fixed "hare" mapping in Ezweb
          (Thanks to tomi-ru)

0.05  Mon May 28 20:53:44 PDT 2007
        - Fixes that fallback flag was ignored in the Vodafone encoding
          (Thanks to Tokuhiro Matsuno)

0.04  Fri May 25 16:31:03 PDT 2007
        - Support KDDI/AU <-> NTT DoCoMo mapping
          (Thanks to Tokuhiro Matsuno)

0.03  Fri Jul 14 15:15:20 JST 2006
        - Added 'shift_jis-softbank' as an alias of 'shift_jis-vodafone'

0.02  Wed Jun 22 17:30:29 JST 2005
        - ucm files are based on cp932.ucm, not shiftjis.ucm

0.01  Wed Jun 22 12:01:25 2005
  Autogenerated by enc2xs version 2.01.
